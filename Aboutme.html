                I'm Cherry Mae Saquin but you can call me 'CM' for short, a young, pretty and small but terrible woman. I'm currently living in the 3rd class of Municipality in the Province of Zamboanga del Sur at Poblacion, Mahayag Zamboanga del Sur, Philippines. I am also a 4th year student taking a course Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Governor Alfonso D. Tan College. Taking this course is so challeging but as my parents said I will never give up until I don't have six degit of salary a month. Thats it. Sometimes I am also a online seller, selling things and clothes is fun and it was makes me less of stress. I really love also keeping sentimental and valuable things.I have a dog his name is Apollo a 2 year old and cutie dogie but he was pass away last october, And right now i miss him so much. I have also my parents who love me so much and I love them too a very supportive parents of all, my father's name is Julieto but everyone call him 'George' and he is so strong and gentleman at his age 57, while my mother's name is Grace and also everyone call him 'Grasya' my 'mama' is super bubbly and cheerful mother she makes everyone laugh at her jokes. I love them both so much I can't live without them, They are my greatest treasure. </p>
